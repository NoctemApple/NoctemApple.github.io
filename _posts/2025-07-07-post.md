I know for a fact I am an obsecure account
on an even more obsecure link hidden
in a portofolio, so this begs the question

"Why did I make a portofolio section?"

Me personally I just made it so I can test
myself using MD file format, but inside
I just wanted a personal space where I can
share thoughts for no reason nor recourse.

It is simply because I can.

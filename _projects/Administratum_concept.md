This post explains/journals my initial start with this project.

Administratum is as of this post meant to simulate finder/folder explorer but with the added twist of being able to return what the user wants or needs.

i.e I want to find a sad cat image staring at a window; using the descriptors of the files/images like title, description, category, and time, with these the application with the use of AI will return what it thinks is the best result.


**Flow chart of Administratum**

In theory this is the flow of the application, the user inputs their query, it is then processed by the AI which then retrieve from the database which then is combined if necessary to produce the result which is then return in the GUI where the user can then decide to open the file, download or view it.

Overall this is the first steps of Administratum, I hope this gives you the gist of it, if you are curious or have any suggestions my details are just in the website
